                    <li>Introduction</li>
                    <p>Tourism, as an ‘industry’ is known to contribute to various sectors of the economy, which are the hospitality sector, the food industry, transportation including air, road, and water transport, tour agencies, cultural events and activities, recreational activities, trade and lastly, area-specific tourism activities</p>
                    <p>Tourism has never been the same as it is now A days. In the olden days people used to travel for work more rather than for leisure. But modern transportation has made it possible to tour different places all across the world.</p>
                    <p>Pakistan’s with its slogan; “It’s beautiful, it’s Pakistan” has managed to generate interest from travelers from across the globe. Pakistan is working hard to eradicate its negative image and promote itself as “Emerging Pakistan”, promoting a considerable tourist offer and a safe and hospitable environment. Constant rise in tourists to almost all the beautiful areas of Pakistan, especially the Swat Valley, AJK and Gilgit Baltistan is on the main stream all over the world. Almost every body including the nationals of Pakistan wants to visit these places which poked us to develop the application to provide facilities to both tourist and tourism agencies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tripak</strong> is the tourism app that will provide services to both tourist and tourism agency. Main motive of this app will be to provide interface to different tourism agencies to advertise the tour details in one place. Tourist will be able to book tickets for tour through our platform and tourism agency will be able to track their vehicles through our system. Currently no such system is introduced in Pakistan. </p>

                    <li>Objectives</li>
                    <p>Our platform will provide user (tourist/tourism Agency) will be provided with following facilities. </p>
                    <ul >
                        <p>•	User will be able to get tour details from different tourism agencies of different tourist places on single platform.</p>
                        <p>•	Tourism Agencies will be able to advertise their tour details on our platform to the correct audience rather than advertising it on different platform.</p>
                        <p>•	Tripak would allow both the parties for a seamless and effortless booking of a trip with the peace of mind for both. The system would also contain a reservation system where the traveler would be able to pay before he departs and would be provided with an online generated receipt.</p>
                        <p>•	Tourism Agencies will be able to track their vehicles through our platform.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Problems for tourists</li>
                    <p>In the past years, tourists have been facing a problem of accessing tour information such as locating national parks and other tourist’s sites in Pakistan. Both internationally and nationally tourists have been having trouble when touring and less aware about which tour is going to which places at different times and dates, most especially about the accommodation. Therefore, I propose the development of a Tripak application whereby the tourist can have access to tourism information anytime anywhere.</p>
                    <li>Problems of Tourism Agencies</li>
                    <p>Tourism agencies has to advertise for their every tour in different
                        platforms  to incorrect audience. And tracking their vehicles is the main problem that we will try to solve through our platform.
                        </p>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <li>Methodology</li>
                <p>•	There will be an application that will give services to Tourism Agencies to advertise their tour details to the correct audience and will be able to track their vehicles by using API’s from Google Maps.</p>
                <p>•	Tourist will be able to book tour advertised by different tourism agencies on our platform.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <li>Project Scope</li>
                <p>Tripak is applicable in any environment where there are tourists and tourism agencies having difficulty in communication with each other. It has scope in tourist industry where both national and international tourists and tourist Agencies will be entertained.</p>
                <p>Tripak will include the verified tourism agencies by the Tripak. The application is an advertising platform, booking platform. The major aim of the application is to guide the tourists locate different tourist sites across the country, and showing contact information which, the Tourist can use to contact the respective tourism agent through our platform. 
                    No internet access would be an issue. Either way, internet is basically available to everyone these days especially in developed cities.

                      <p style="font-size: 1vw;"><strong>i. Risks Involved : </strong>No internet access would be an issue. </p>
                    <p style="width: 80%;font-size: 1vw;"><strong>ii. Resource Requirement : </strong>Compatible devices both of tourists to book tour and also the tourism agencies vehicles captains should have compatible device to tracking them where they are heading.</p>

                    <li>Solution Application Areas</li>
                    <p>Tripak is going to target tourism industry to benefit both the tourist and tourism agencies. The application of this particular projects would be in the already established tourism agencies, which are looking to expand their business by making use of the latest technology. This solution would allow the participating travel agency to have an edge over their competitors. Thus the application area would be the Tourism Industry.</p>

                    For current implementation, we are going with JavaScript.
